# Five for the Future (WordPress.org/five-for-the-future)

[Five for the Future](https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future) is an initiative promoting the WordPress community’s contribution to the platform’s growth. As an open source project, WordPress is created by a diverse collection of people from around the world.

The program encourages organizations to contribute five percent of their resources to WordPress development, to maintain a "golden ratio" of contributors to users.


## Contributing

In order to contribute with code changes, you'll want to set up a local environment to test changes and then push the changes to a Pull Request on this Github Repository.

### Initial environment setup

1. Use whichever local WordPress development setup you prefer and create a new local WP site.
1. Find the `wp-content` folder and delete it (make a backup if you have data you don't want to lose data you already have there).
1. Fork the [five-for-the-future](https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future) repository under your own Github account.
1. Run `git clone git@github.com:[your username]/five-for-the-future.git wp-content`, replacing `[your username]` with your github username to clone your forked repo.
1. Ensure this newly cloned `wp-content` folder is where it should be in the WP structure.
1. Copy over the base theme with: `svn export https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/themes/pub/wporg themes/pub/wporg` (this should be run from the `wp-content` folder).
1. If you are making changes to the plugins, you can run `composer install` at `/wp-content/plugins/wporg-5ftf` and then `composer run test` to run the WP unit tests.

### Configuring the site

1. Login to your site and activate the "Five for the Future" theme and plugin.
1. Navigate to `/wp-content/themes/wporg-5ftf` and run: `npm install && npm run build`

### Setting up default data

1. Set your permalinks to "Post name" at `Settings > Permalinks`.
1. Run the WP XML Importer at `Tools > Import` and select `wp-content/.env/import.wxr`.
1. Set the Primary Menu at `Appearance > Menu`.
1. Set "About" as the static home page at `Settings > Reading`.
1. Add new Pledges on the "Add New Pledge" page. Note that you'll need to use valid WP usernames on your install.
	1. Set the new entry to Published in the `Five For the Future > Pledges admin` area.
	1. Find the "Sending email" log entry in the pledge admin and copy/paste the link in a new tab to confirm the email.
	1. Go to the `Five For the Future > Contributors` page and publish the post(s) via quick edit.
	1. Your new pledge should appear on the `/pledges/` pages now.


## Scripts

If you making changes to the theme's CSS, you can run `npm start` at `/wp-content/themes/wporg-5ftf` to watch for CSS changes and automatically compile.

If you are making changes to the plugins, you can run `composer update` at `/wp-content/plugins/wporg-5ftf` and then `composer run test` to run the WP unit tests. Run `composer test:watch` if you want to run the tests every time you change a file.

And lastly, you can run PHPCS for both the theme and the plugin at the root `/wp-content/` folder by running `composer install` there once, followed by `composer run phpcs` when you want to code scan.


* `composer run phpcs` - Lint the entire codebase
* `composer run phpcs -- -a themes/wporg-5ftf/` - Lint a specific folder, interactively
* `composer run phpcbf` - Fix linter warnings (when possible)
* `composer run test` - Run unit tests
* `composer run test:watch` - Run unit tests after each file change.

See [the theme README](./themes/wporg-5ftf/README.md) for scripts specific to the theme.



### Submitting Pull Requests

The first thing you'll want to do before changing any code is create a new branch based on the `production` branch. Then you can commit your code changes locally and push this new branch to your forked repository on Github. Then visit the [official repository](https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future/) and you should see the option to open up a Pull Request based on the recently pushed branch on your fork.

Overtime your fork will fall out of date with what is on the main repository. What you'll want to do is keep your fork's `production` branch synced with the upstream `production` branch. To do this:

1) In the `/wp-content/` folder, run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future`
2) Then `git fetch upstream` to pull down the upstream changes.
3) Lastly, `git checkout production && git merge upstream/production` to sync up the your local branch with the upstream branch.

This is why it's important to always create a branch on your local fork before making code changes. You want to keep the `production` branch clean and in sync with the upstream repository.


## Syncing to production

This is only relevant for committers; contributors don't need to worry about syncing.

The canonical source for this project is [github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future](https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future). The contents are synced to the dotorg SVN repo to run on production, because we don't deploy directly from GitHub, for reliability reasons.

The plugin and theme lives in the private SVN repo instead of `meta.svn.wordpress.org`, because the code is already open-sourced, and we don't want to clutter the Meta logs and Slack channels with noise from "Syncing w/ Git repository..." commits.

To sync to SVN, run `bin/sync/5ftf.sh` from a w.org sandbox.
